Another new feature of Python is the r-string, which is a string that is marked as a raw string 
by prefixing it with an r. 
This means that backslashes are treated as literal characters and not as escape characters. 
This is useful for regular expressions and Windows paths, which use backslashes a lot. Here's an example:

"""

print(r"C\\Users\\Stark\\Documents\\Books\\Python")
