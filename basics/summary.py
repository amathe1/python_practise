Q. What is Python ?
A. Programming language used for 
        - Servers side automation
        - Data anlytics & visualization
        - AI
        - ML
        - Website data, file parsing PDF, text files etc.,

Q. We can do all thes things with other programming languages as well ? What's the big deal ?
A. We can solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of code
   
Ex : Extract first 3 lines in "Hello world"

Code :   - c#  : str.Substring(0,3)
         - Java script : str.substr(0,3)
         - Python : str[0:3]  ==> See how clear the code is !!

- It has simple yet powerful syntax
- High level language : No need to worry about complex tasks like memory management
- Cross-platform : We can build and run python applications on Windows, Mac & Linux
- It has huge community across world! Some will be there to help you for sure
- It has large ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools ; it means whatever you wana do, 
    some one else already done it before(20 years history)

Conclusion : Multipurpose language with simple, clean and beginner;friendly syntax.
